🧑‍💻 Internship Task Completion: Web Development – Responsive Landing Page
I am excited to share that I have successfully completed another internship task focused on Web Development, where I designed and developed a Responsive Landing Page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📌 Project Highlights:
🏗️ Built a clean and accessible page layout using HTML5

🎨 Designed a responsive and visually appealing interface with CSS3, ensuring compatibility across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)

💡 Added interactivity and enhanced user experience using JavaScript for features like smooth scrolling, form validation, and dynamic content

🌐 Ensured cross-browser support and followed modern web design best practices

💡 What I Learned:
Strengthened skills in responsive web design using media queries and flex/grid layouts

Gained a deeper understanding of user interface (UI) principles and mobile-first design

Practiced implementing JavaScript-driven interactions and client-side validation

Learned how to structure clean, maintainable, and scalable frontend code

This task has helped me sharpen my skills in building production-ready, responsive websites and improved my attention to design details and usability. I’m looking forward to applying these skills to more advanced projects in the future.
